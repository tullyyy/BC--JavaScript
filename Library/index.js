// The public library
// Let's practice representing data in our web application. We will create a simple library website for which we need an object representing a book.

// Stage 1:
// Design an object which will represent a book in a public library. The book should have at least these properties
// title
// it should allow for multiple authors
// number of pages
// publish year
// whether the book can be borrowed home or can be only viewed in the library
// whether the book is borrowed or present in the library.
// Once you have the structure, pick three or four favorite books of yours and create an array of them.
// Make a simple (but nice) website which displays the list of these books in some way.
// Stage 2:
// At the bottom of the page create a form which will allow the library administrator to add a new book to the library.
// In the list of books add a button which will allow the user to borrow the book it it is not yer borrowed by somebody else.
